# Face-Mask-Detection
Face Mask Detection using Machine Learning Algorithm(implementing with existing dataset and by creating own dataset)
This project is implemented in Python. 
1. With Existing Dataset

   Dataset for this can be downloaded from kaggle- https://www.kaggle.com/search?q=face+mask+detection
  
2. By creating our own dataset
   
   Dataset in this case can be created using OpenCV python library, VideoCapture() method.
